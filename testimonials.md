#### Junhong Chang, Former Director, AMRO

I had a pleasure working with Pinky for almost three years when I led AMRO at a critical juncture after it was transformed into an international organization in 2016. As the first and the sole PR officer, Pinky has done an amazing job in setting up a strong foundation for its PR function and enhancing AMRO's voice and visibility in Asia. Her extensive knowledge of both traditional media and digital media, coupled with her creativity and determination for excellence, sets her apart from others.

Her capability to pull off complex projects in a very short time with soberness was particularly impressive to me. Not only is she versatile, but she also approaches every project with the utmost care and explores every option meticulously.
Pinky is also the key person behind a number of office-wide initiatives such as the Cultural Corner and Photo Contest, which embrace cultural diversity and promote a pleasant environment in the workplace.
Pinky is really an outstanding staff at AMRO.

### Chaipat Poonpatpipul, Lead Economist and Group Head, AMRO

Pinky is a very professional PR officer who has competently and successfully helped set up our PR framework from scratch. She is a very reliable and meticulous staff. Her oral and writing communication skills are also superb. She has never failed to impress me with the quality of her works.

### Chuin Hwei Ng, Former Group Head of Regional Surveillance, AMRO

My team and I had the pleasure of working closely with Huong on launching AMRO's inaugural flagship surveillance report in May 2017. Huong conceptualised and executed the media strategy for the report, which involved extensive media outreach and event management in our stakeholder countries in ASEAN, and China, Japan and Korea. We were all extremely impressed by her strategic vision, resourcefulness and tenacity in this process, and her sunny disposition has also brought humour and laughter to our many meetings.

### Soren Davidsen, Former Senior Governance Specialist, the World Bank

Pinky is an excellent communication strategist and a great team player. She is very familiar with modern communication tools and has a demonstrated ability to contextualize these tools.

### Le Hai Yen, Associate Business Partner, Ogilvy

It's my great pleasure to work with Pinky in her capacity of the managing editor of VietNamNet. She is proactive, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and professional enough to attract and inspire all people working with her. She also has great enthusiasm in encouraging & mentoring young reporters in their career path.
A small girl with great mind - Pinky would be a very big asset for any organisation.

### Do Minh Thuy, Director and Coach at MediaMe

Pinky is very smart, inspirational and dedicated. She's a very active member and coach for the Alumni Engagement Innovation Fund wining project called "Empowering Young Vietnamese Reporters". With her rich knowledge and practical experience, Pinky contributed a great deal in designing our EVJ course, giving lectures and mentoring. Not only the students, but other instructors like us also enjoyed her class very much. The class was always filled with positive energy that she brought in.
I'm confident to say that she's the one who can add tremendous values and is a great asset to any organization or company where she works for.
