### AMRO’s ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook (AREO) 2017/2018/2019 Launches and Roadshows

AREO 2017 is the annual flagship report and the first publication that AMRO ever published. By building up strong relationships with the media across the region and deploying a wide range of strategic engagement, I made this a successful debut despite the fact the AMRO was little known.

The report launch in Yokohama in May 2017 was attended by more than 20 journalists and 40 non-press participants, totaling almost 50 hits in major news outlets, including CNBC, Bloomberg, Xinhua News Agency, the Nikkei, the Business Times, the Straits Times, the Jakarta Post, the Philippines Star, Vietnam News, among others. It was followed by a roadshow to Beijing, Singapore, Jakarta, Bangkok, Malaysia, and Washington, D.C., in the following months, which yielded dozens of stories in local media in respective countries.

The AREO 2018/2019 launch in Manila and Fiji also saw great turnouts. First week coverage totaled more than 100 news stories across international, regional, and local news agencies.  


### The World Bank’s #EndPoverty Social Campaign (2012 - 2016)

Being cascaded from the global to regional to national levels, #EndPoverty is the largest social campaign of the World Bank, which aims to raise awareness and call for collective action in the fight against poverty.

From 2013 to 2016, I led this campaign in Vietnam with various themes and innovative approaches, including two Facebook photo contests, an online interactive map breaking down poverty to the provincial level, a university road show to discuss solutions with the youth, blogs, videos, and numerous mini campaigns.

Engaging hundreds of thousands of participants, this social campaign helped raise awareness about multi-dimensional and persistent poverty in the country.

I have organized numerous training courses on media engagement, social media, and photography to equip staff at AMRO and the World Bank with knowledge and skills to effectively engage in various media platforms.

I also provided training for hundreds of leaders and staff of World Bank-supported project management units to ensure their smooth and effective communications with stakeholders, which significantly contributed to the efficiency of the projects.

In addition, I have engaged in several community projects that provided training and coaching for young journalists and media students. Many of my students have become professional journalists and media practitioners.
