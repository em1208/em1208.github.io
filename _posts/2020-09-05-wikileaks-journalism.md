The leak of classified documents and U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010 initiated a debate over the impact of WikiLeaks on mainstream media. One year and many leaked documents later, can we say if WikiLeaks has really changed traditional media outlets? However, the question is: which has really changed in the end?

When he started WikiLeaks in 2006, Julian Assange believed in the power of original, unedited material. He assumed such documents would achieve that “readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth,” as stated on the website. Back then the site only published original material and short summaries.

After three years of sharing a lot of valuable material on the website and not getting much attention from either the mainstream media or the public, Mr. Assange changed his strategy.

In spring 2010, a 2007 video from Baghdad – in which an US Apache helicopter fired on and killed civilians – marked the first turning point: Julian Assange presented it at a press conference.

“WikiLeaks adopted a more journalistic approach — editing and annotating,” David Carr, media columnist with the New York Times, wrote in December 2010. The disclosure of the video gained much more attention from the press.

#### A new player

Starting in July 2010, WikiLeaks began its partnership with some established news outlets by providing them with a massive amount of classified US government documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

WikiLeaks shared the material with several well-known publications, including the British Guardian, the New York Times, German magazine Der Spiegel, El Pais (Spain) and Le Monde (France). They later also published the classified diplomatic cables of the correspondence between the US State Department and US embassies all over the world.

Julian Assange was heavily criticised within WikiLeaks for turning away from its core philosophy, said Marcel Rosenbach of Der Spiegel. Mr. Rosenbach was involved in the co-operation between the magazine and WikiLeaks and has written the book “WikiLeaks – Enemy of the State”.

“It was not so much WikiLeaks that had a great impact on traditional journalism. It was more the traditional media that changed WikiLeaks over the course of 2010,” Mr. Rosenbach told young journalists from Asia and Africa at this year’s IIJ Summer Academy in Hamburg.

However, he added that the journalism world also has changed due to “the new player in the field.”

According to Mr. Rosenbach, there was an agreement between the five publications for simultaneous publication of the internationally relevant documents, but each newspaper chose topics that connected to their specific audience. It has been the first time ever some giant competitors in the global media industry worked closely together to analyse and publish such important stories, Mr. Rosenbach said.

“This kind of cooperation alone was quite fascinating, and it’s something new that hasn’t been there before,” Mr. Rosenbach said.
He added that after the WikiLeaks reports, the papers have also cooperated in some other cases.

Mr. Rosenbach pointed out that WikiLeaks has inspired many newsrooms across the world to think about establishing their own safe digital platforms where whistleblowers can safely post material.

“Any news outlet has to think about the way to communicate with sources and how to keep sources secured in the digital environment,” he added.
He also said that in some countries, which have strict media laws, traditional journalists may send their reports to WikiLeaks as a publishing platform because it is “international and uncensorable.”
