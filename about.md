Huong “Pinky” Vu is a highly creative and strategic communications expert with 15 years of experience in East and Southeast Asia. She is passionate about telling impactful stories and communicating them in a way that interests the target audience.

At the age of 10, Pinky published her first news bulletin – in hand-writing form - to inform friends in her primary school about the unhygienic ice cream sold at their school gate. The publication quickly became a hit, and she even received pre-order for the next edition.
Her childhood passion then turned into a profession.

Pinky is currently a Public Relations Officer at the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) based in Singapore. As AMRO's first Public Relations Officer, she has led the effort to turn this young international organization into a thought leader in macroeconomics and financial stability in East and Southeast Asia. AMRO has been featured in top global and regional news outlets such as Bloomberg, CNBC, BBC, Nikkei Asian Review, CNA, the Business Times, to name a few.

Prior to joining AMRO, she was part of the World Bank's East Asia Pacific digital communications team, where she adopted innovation and technologies in story-telling. During that time, she led communications initiatives for more than 10 multi-million projects across industries ranging from education, health, to infrastructure and agriculture. She’s humbled and proud to contribute to these projects that brought life-changing impact to some of the most vulnerable communities in her home country, Vietnam.

Before moving into public relations and communications, Pinky worked as a journalist in Vietnam and the US for four years, which equipped her with a strong editorial sense and solid understanding of news generation. At the age of 27, she was appointed to be the youngest Managing Editor of of VietNamNet Newspaper, where she led a team of seasoned journalists and contributing writers to win the Best Team of the Year award in 2011.

Pinky believes in the pay-it-forward spirit and giving back to the society. She has been involved in a number of community projects in Vietnam. These include providing hands-on training on media skills for students and young journalists, improving teaching skills for kindergarten teachers to work with autistic kids, and providing unique learning experience to ethnic minority students. She is the co-author and editor of a book titled “News Gathering and Writing: A Practical Guide to Journalism.”

Pinky holds a Master’s Degree in Journalism (New Media) from Northwestern University (the US) under a Fulbright scholarship and a Bachelor’s Degree in Journalism from the Academy of Journalism and Communications (Vietnam).
